        I'm an AI developer passionate about building data-driven systems that bridge the gap between machine learning, explainability, and real-world impact. My favorite work lies at the intersection of data science and intelligent systems, transforming complex information into meaningful, interpretable insights that empower better decision-making.

        After completing my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bachelor's final project</a>, which focused on detecting anomalies in patient vital signs, I realized the potential of AI in healthcare and its broader societal impact. This inspired me to pursue a Master’s in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, specializing in data science and machine learning, to contribute to projects where AI can truly make a difference.

        I've since worked on various AI-driven projects, developing models and data pipelines while emphasizing explainability and ethical application. I'm especially curious about how technology can adapt to human needs and generate tangible benefits in society.

        In my spare time, you'll often find me swimming, running, or reflecting on my next steps.
