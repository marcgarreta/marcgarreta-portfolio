This project is the creation of my **personal portfolio website**, available at: **[https://marcgarretabasora.vercel.app](https://marcgarretabasora.vercel.app)**  

Built with **React + Vite** and deployed on **Vercel**, this website serves both as my personal site and as a learning challenge to explore new technologies and improve my skills.

The website allows users to clearly see sections such as **About Me**, **Experience**, **Projects**, and **Certifications**. It is currently designed for **desktop screens** and is **not yet mobile-friendly**, though mobile support is planned for a future implementation.
